# CleanCity Test Plan

## 📋 Overview
| **Project**      | CleanCity Waste Pickup Scheduler |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Version**      | 1.0                              |
| **Test Type**    | Functional, UI, Security, Performance |
| **Test Level**   | System Testing                   |

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Validate core user workflows (scheduling, dashboard, admin)
2. Ensure cross-browser compatibility
3. Verify security controls (XSS/SQLi prevention)
4. Confirm performance benchmarks (LCP <2.5s)
