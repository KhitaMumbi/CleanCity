CleanCity Test Plan
Version: 1.0
Date: 16/07/2025
Prepared by: Dev Trio

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the testing strategy, scope, and approach for the CleanCity Waste Pickup Scheduler web application. It ensures that all functional and non-functional requirements are validated before deployment.

1.2 Scope
Testing will cover:
‚úî Functional Testing (Authentication, Pickup Scheduling, Admin Features, Feedback, Awareness)
‚úî UI/UX Testing (Responsiveness, Accessibility, Navigation)
‚úî Security Testing (Input Validation, Role-Based Access)
‚úî Performance Testing (LocalStorage Handling, Page Load Times)
‚ùå Backend API Testing (Not applicable, since data is stored in localStorage)

1.3 Objectives
‚úÖ Ensure all features work as per the Functional Requirements Specification (FRS).
‚úÖ Verify cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
‚úÖ Validate security measures (XSS/SQLi prevention, role-based access).
‚úÖ Confirm user-friendly error handling.

2. Test Approach
2.1 Testing Types
Test Type	Description	Tools/Methods
Functional Testing	Verify all user workflows (login, scheduling, feedback, admin tasks)	Manual + Jest (if unit tests exist)
UI/UX Testing	Check responsiveness, accessibility, and design consistency	Browser DevTools, WAVE (accessibility)
Security Testing	Test for XSS, SQLi, and improper access control	Manual input validation
Compatibility Testing	Ensure app works across browsers/devices	BrowserStack (if available)
2.2 Test Environment
Frontend: Chrome (latest), Firefox, Safari, Edge

Devices: Desktop, Tablet (iPad), Mobile (iPhone/Android)

OS: Windows 11, macOS, iOS, Android

Storage: localStorage (simulated)

2.3 Test Data
Demo Accounts:

Regular User: user@cleancity.com / password123

Admin: admin@cleancity.com / admin123

Test Pickup Requests:

REQ001 (Pending), REQ002 (Completed), REQ003 (Missed)

3. Test Execution Strategy
3.1 Test Phases
Phase	Description	Test Cases Covered
Smoke Testing	Basic functionality check (login, navigation)	TC-001, TC-005, TC-023
Regression Testing	Re-test after bug fixes	All impacted test cases
Final Sanity Check	Pre-release verification	Critical test cases (TC-009, TC-017, TC-019)
3.2 Test Schedule
Task	Duration	Responsible
Test Case Preparation	2 days	QA Team
Functional Testing	3 days	QA Team
UI/UX Testing	1 day	QA + Design
Security Testing	1 day	QA Team
Bug Fixing & Retesting	2 days	Dev + QA
4. Defect Management
4.1 Bug Reporting
Tool: Jira / GitHub Issues

Severity Levels:

Critical (üî¥): Blocks core functionality (e.g., login failure).

High (üü†): Major feature broken (e.g., pickup request not submitting).

Medium (üü°): Minor UI issues (e.g., misaligned buttons).

Low (üü¢): Cosmetic issues (e.g., typo).

4.2 Exit Criteria
‚úÖ All Critical & High bugs fixed.

‚úÖ 100% of test cases executed.

‚úÖ No open P1/P2 bugs remaining.

5. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
localStorage data loss on browser clear	Warn users to export data
Slow performance on low-end devices	Optimize JS/CSS
Admin access accidentally given to users	Rigorous role testing
6. Sign-Off
Role	Name	Approval (‚úî)	Date
QA Lead	[Name]		
Development Lead	[Name]		
Product Manager	[Name]		
Next Steps
Review test cases with the team.

Execute tests as per schedule.

Report & track bugs.

Conduct final sign-off before release.
